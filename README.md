# airbnb-clone-project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

## Project Goals

- Primary goal: learning — provide a hands-on, end-to-end backend-focused experience building a production-like booking platform.
- Practice designing scalable APIs, secure payment flows, resilient database schemas, automated testing, and CI/CD for continuous delivery.
- Explore modern backend tooling (Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL), background processing, containerization, monitoring, and infrastructure automation.

## Team Roles

Below are suggested roles and responsibilities for this project (adapted from common team structures such as the ITRexGroup guidance):

- Backend Developer
	- Designs and implements server-side logic, REST/GraphQL APIs, business rules, and integrations with databases and third-party services (payments, email, maps).
	- Writes unit/integration tests and collaborates on API contracts with frontend and QA.

- Database Administrator (DBA)
	- Designs the relational schema, indexes, and migration strategy for PostgreSQL; tunes queries and maintains backups/restore procedures.
	- Ensures data integrity, access controls, and performs capacity planning.

- DevOps / Platform Engineer
	- Builds and maintains CI/CD pipelines, container images, deployment manifests (Docker, Kubernetes or Docker Compose), monitoring, and logging.
	- Automates infra provisioning (Terraform/CloudFormation) and manages environment secrets and registries.

- QA / Test Engineer
	- Creates test plans, writes automated tests (end-to-end, integration), performs exploratory testing, and verifies security and compliance checks.
	- Works with CI to gate merges and deploys.

- Security Engineer
	- Defines security requirements and implements authentication, authorization, encryption, vulnerability scanning, and secure coding practices.
	- Reviews third-party dependencies and assists with incident response planning.

- Frontend Developer
	- Implements the user-facing interface (web/mobile) and works with API contracts, handles client-side validation, and optimizes the UX flow for search, booking, and messaging.

- Product Manager / Project Lead
	- Prioritizes features, writes acceptance criteria, and coordinates across the team to deliver increments on schedule.

## Technology Stack

This project uses a modern backend-focused stack. Each technology is chosen to help build a strong, efficient backend:

- Django: Python web framework for building the core server app and business logic. Provides ORM, authentication, and a solid ecosystem.
- Django REST Framework (DRF): Adds conveniences for building RESTful APIs, serialization, pagination, and view layers (optional when using GraphQL).
- GraphQL (Graphene or Ariadne): Flexible API layer for client-driven queries and efficient data fetching, used alongside or instead of REST for certain endpoints.
- PostgreSQL: Primary relational database for ACID-compliant storage of users, properties, bookings, and transactions.
- Redis: In-memory store for caching, rate limiting counters, and Celery broker/backing for lightweight tasks.
- Celery: Background task queue for sending emails, processing payments asynchronously, and other long-running jobs.
- Docker & Docker Compose: Containerization and local orchestration for consistent developer environments and reproducible builds.
- Kubernetes (optional): For production orchestration and scaling of services.
- Nginx + Gunicorn / uWSGI: Web server and WSGI application server for serving the Django app in production.
- Payments: Stripe (recommended) or another PCI-compliant gateway for handling payments and refunds.
- Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab CI: CI systems to run tests, linters, and build/deploy pipelines. Jenkins is useful for flexible on-prem pipelines; GitHub Actions is tightly integrated with GitHub repos.
- Terraform: Infrastructure-as-code for provisioning cloud resources (VPCs, databases, load balancers) reproducibly.
- Sentry: Error tracking and performance monitoring to detect runtime issues.
- Prometheus + Grafana: Metrics collection and visualization for system health and performance.
- pytest: Testing framework for unit and integration tests.

## Database Design

Key entities and their important fields. This is a high-level starting point; adjust fields and constraints as the app requirements evolve.

- Users
	- id (UUID)
	- email (unique)
	- hashed_password
	- name
	- is_host (boolean)
	- created_at, updated_at

- Properties
	- id (UUID)
	- host_id (FK -> Users.id)
	- title
	- description
	- location (city, country, latitude, longitude)
	- price_per_night
	- amenities (JSON or relation)

- Bookings
	- id (UUID)
	- property_id (FK -> Properties.id)
	- guest_id (FK -> Users.id)
	- start_date, end_date
	- total_price
	- status (pending, confirmed, cancelled)

- Reviews
	- id (UUID)
	- booking_id (FK -> Bookings.id) or property_id
	- reviewer_id (FK -> Users.id)
	- rating (1-5)
	- comment
	- created_at

- Payments
	- id (UUID)
	- booking_id (FK -> Bookings.id)
	- amount
	- currency
	- provider_charge_id (from Stripe or provider)
	- status (succeeded, failed, refunded)

Relationships (high level):

- A User can be a host and can list multiple Properties.
- A Property belongs to one host (User). A Property can have many Bookings.
- A Booking belongs to a Property and to the guest (User).
- A Booking can have one or more Payments (e.g., deposit + final payment).
- Reviews are linked to Bookings or Properties and are authored by Users.

## Feature Breakdown

- User management
	- Registration, login (email/password, OAuth), profile management, and role flagging (guest/host). Enables secure access and personalization.

- Property management
	- Hosts can create/edit property listings, upload photos, set pricing and availability rules. Drives the supply side of the platform.

- Search & availability
	- Geolocation-based search, filters (price, amenities), and availability calendar to match guests with suitable properties.

- Booking & payment system
	- Booking workflow with availability checks, pricing calculation, deposit/full payment flows, and integration with a payment gateway for secure transactions.

- Reviews & ratings
	- Guests leave reviews after stays; aggregated ratings help build trust and quality signals for listings.

- Messaging & notifications
	- In-app messaging and email/push notifications for booking confirmations, host communications, and system alerts.

- Admin dashboard
	- Tools for platform admins to manage users, listings, disputes, and perform moderation.

- Reporting & analytics
	- Usage and financial reports, occupancy metrics, and alerts for abnormal behaviors.

## API Security

Key security measures to implement and why they matter:

- Authentication
	- Use secure methods such as JWT with refresh tokens or OAuth2 for delegated access. Proper authentication protects user accounts and access to private resources.

- Authorization
	- Implement RBAC (roles) and fine-grained permissions so hosts and guests see only what they should. Prevents privilege escalation and data leaks.

- Transport security (TLS)
	- Enforce HTTPS for all traffic to protect credentials, tokens, and personal data in transit.

- Rate limiting & throttling
	- Protect APIs from brute-force attacks and abuse by setting sensible rate limits per IP/user and applying graceful backoff.

- Input validation and sanitization
	- Validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent injection attacks (SQL, command, or XSS in stored data).

- Secure payment handling
	- Avoid storing raw card data; use a PCI-compliant provider (Stripe/Checkout). Securely handle webhooks and reconcile payment statuses.

- Logging & monitoring
	- Maintain audit logs for security-relevant events and use monitoring/alerting to detect anomalies and incidents quickly.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD is the practice of automating builds, tests, and deployments so teams can deliver reliable changes faster. For this project, a pipeline should:

- Run linters, static analysis (e.g., Bandit, Flake8), and unit tests on every PR.
- Build Docker images and run integration tests in an isolated environment.
- Deploy to staging automatically on merge to a main branch, and optionally to production after approvals.

Suggested tools:

- GitHub Actions / Jenkins / GitLab CI: Run the CI workflow — tests, linting, and building artifacts.
- Docker & Docker Registry: Package services and store immutable images.
- Kubernetes or Docker Compose: Orchestrate deployments in staging and production.
- Terraform: Provision and manage infrastructure as code.
- Snyk / Dependabot: Automated dependency scanning and security alerts.
- SonarQube: Code quality and security scanning.

## Notes

- This README is a starting blueprint for learning and prototyping a production-like backend. You can simplify or extend components (e.g., skip Kubernetes for local dev) depending on time and learning goals.
